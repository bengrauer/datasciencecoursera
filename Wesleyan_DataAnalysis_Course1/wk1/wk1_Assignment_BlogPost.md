## Coursera Course - Data Analysis and Interpretation (Wesleyan University)
## Course 1 - Week 1 - Assignment - Blog Post
Please note that instead of signing up for a Tumblr account, I have chosen to leverage an existing account on Github.  The reason for this is I didn't want to sign up for another social media site  when I have github already setup and established.  I am re-creating the blog post in md (mark down), and can utilize juypter notebooks to show-case any code examples later with ease.


### Step 1 - Choose a Data Set
The data set I have chosen is a properly scrubbed and public lending/loan data set.  It contains good financial/loan funding information to work with, which interests me from a financial angle of research.  I have been eager to dive into this data set to see what trends or insights it may produce, more specifically with default or profitibility patterns.

### Step 2 - Identify a specific topic of interest
The topic of interest I have chosen to study is how defaulted loans may correlate to other specific loan elements. I.E. can I identify or segment any high-risk groups from the data?

### Step 3 - Code Book
The codebook is attached in this directory as "CodeBook.xlsx".  The specific columns I may be interested in are pre-identified as "int_rate", "dti", "revol_util" and "recoveries".  I am not sure if that is the full set or if I will need more.

### Step 4 - Identify a second topic
The second topic I would like to explore is what categories of loans are most profitable?

### Step 5 - Add questions/items/variables documenting this second topic to your personal codebook
The fields "purpose", "int_rate", "term", and there may be others not yet identified.


### Step 6 - Existing literature about the data set.
I have found alternative evidence of prior analysis of the data set.
- [Lending Club Analysis](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/analysis-of-lending-club-s-data)

### Step 7 - Develop a hypothesis
I hypothesize that the majority of defaults will be within the higher interest rate bracket along with higher rate "dti" (debt to income ratios) measures.
